Hi there, you user of the web. You just came across with my digital garden! - Hi, I'm Fernando :) 

### Me 
If you don't know who am I, well I'm Fernando Obregon, I'm a software developer, currently living in Dublin, Ireland. You can stay and read if you're interested about [[Zettelkasten/tech|Technology]] , [[Zettelkasten/history|History]] , [[Zettelkasten/productivity|Productivity]] or [[Zettelkasten/Minimalism|Minimalism]]



### My goal

My goal is to provide easy information for people to develop their own things (AKA [[DIY in Tech]])  so they're aware of;
- [[How the internet works]]
- [[How your devices work]]
- [[Make your life easier by removing friction]]
### Any news?

Currently I'm learning [[astro]] and some of [[iOS]] development ^535ac9
