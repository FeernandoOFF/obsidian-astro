# My Great Heading {#custom-id}

Hi there, you user of the web. You just came across with my digital garden! - Hi, I'm Fernando :)

### Me

If you don't know who am I, well I'm Fernando Obregon, I'm a software developer, currently living in Dublin, Ireland. You can stay and read if you're interested about [Technology](Zettelkasten/tech.md) , [History](Zettelkasten/history.md) , [Productivity](Zettelkasten/productivity.md) or [[Minimalism]]

### My goal

My goal is to provide easy information for people to develop their own things (AKA [[DIY in Tech]]) so they're aware of;

- [[How the internet works]]
- [[How your devices work]]
- [[Make your life easier by removing friction]]

### Any news?

Currently I'm learning [[astro]] and some of [[iOS]] development
