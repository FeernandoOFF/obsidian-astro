# Pronoun
> [!note]
> Look at **him** he looks too old

A pronoun is generally used to replace a [[Noun]] in a sentence. Generally this involves [[anaphora]] (or context) where the **Meaning of the pronoun depends on the**  [[antecendent]]. IE.

> [!info]
> After all this time we spent together I'll miss you all!

Eventough we use **you** in the sentence and you has double meaning (singular or plural) the meaning that the pronoun acquires is the plural form. This is due to the [[antecendent]]
