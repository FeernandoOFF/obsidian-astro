## Evolution
The first branch that came was the Italic alongside Celtic; which Spread tough all the current [[France]] , [[Germany]] and[[Italy]] among other counties. Then the Alps divided them on **1500BC** At this point we have:
- [[Celtic]] on most parts of north of Europe

- Greek on most par of [[Greece]] and [[Macedonia]]

Until the [[Roman Empire]] begins to grow spreading the Latin language across the [[Mediterranean]] and Western Europe **erasing** all of the Italic and most of the [[Celtic]] languages on the way

- The Latin language had different dialects due to the interaction between cultures and the size of the empire 
- After the fall of the Roman Empire those dialects evolved into their own languages this being  the [[Romance Languages]] this being
	- British (Extinct)
	- Pannonian (Extinct)
	- African (Extinct)
	- Sardinian (Extinct)
	- Romanian
	- Western Romance
		- Italian
		- French
		- Spanish
		- Portugese 

As the Society became more centralized the empires choose one dialect as the one to speak in all their different territory
- Spanish
	- The Castillian Kings choose the **Castillian** as the foundation to Spanish
		- Dialects discarted: Galician, Leonese, Basquese and Catalan

- France
	- The French King chose the `d'o√Øl`
