### Configure to run apps

#### Accounts
You can add your Apple Developer Account (you don't have to pay - yet) by going to preferences -> accounts and add your AppleID

#### Run the app

There are two ways that you can run an app: 

- Simulated 
	- You can select a simulated device on the dropdown at the top left side and click the play button

- Your own device
	- Update everything to the latest version or make sure that XCode can develop for your device OS
	- Select your device from the status bar (next to your project name) hit 'Play'
	- Connect your device -> 'Trust' -> Allow from this developer
