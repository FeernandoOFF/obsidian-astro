## Why is tech so important?

The technology is not **just Informatics**; It's a way to simplify our lives and  it has been helping us since the [[discover of fire]] all the way to the invention of the [[microcontrollers]].

>  The application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes

We live un a complex world where everything seems done for us; from food, communication to heating on our houses. As you can see, almost everything that simplifies our lives could be called technology. **It is all around us** 



## The importance of Informatics


In this "blog" I'll focus on informatics and a little bit of electronics, mainly because is my area (hehe) but also there're some points that make the them so interesting and so important.

- First and most important is that, now days **every one interacts with a computer in some way**.  And It's vital that everyone has an idea what happens underneath. 

- Secondly is their scalability; You can build almost whatever you want and if it results a great business Idea (See [[startups]]) you can easily scale them, Outside the Economic part it also can be shared to help other people.

- Accessibility related to the point that everyone interacts with a computer somehow, is easily accessible and you can start right now while you're reading this. (See [[Start with Javascript]])

- And finally, **You only need your brain** to make it work!

### Drawbacks

When starting to create products you can start copying and adapting ideas that already exist, then solve your own problems.... 
But...

[[The benefits of a system donâ€™t increase with his complexity]]. 

And you're likely to solve imaginary problems and make your life harder than initially was.

- Responsability / Ethics

If this sounds good for you and you're interested you may say 'Okay, but **how I get started?** this seems like a big world' - The reality is that that's true, but don't worry... Yet 

## How **you**  can start in tech?

One important note is that you  don't have to know [[maths]] to start creating things, in the next section I'll show how a diagram to know what you can use to solve your needs. 


> [!seealso] DIY
>  If you only want to solve something quickly such as:
>  - Blog, Webpage, App (Mobile, Web, Multiplatform)
>  - Shortcuts, scripts, 
>  - Electronic automation
>  - Automation for daily life
>  - Internet presence
>  - 
>  > You should have a look at [DIY in Tech](DIY%20in%20Tech)


### Tip: Tools that you'll work with
If you want to take it seriously you **should** start with this things
- [[Terminal]]
- [[Git]]
This tools are not by themselves the actual thing that you will develop. But you'll be interacting with them most of the time and you should be comfortable using them


### Areas of Tech

**Areas/Process of an app development**

- [[Project Manager]] - Coordination and communication with clients and devs
- [[UI/UX ]] - Work with the client to create a Interface that satisfies their needs
- [[Frontend]] - Developer who is in charge of implement the designs and bring interaction and data
- [[Backend]] - Developer who creates the data behind the frontend app(s) 
- [[DevOps]] - The person who sustains the infrastructure of both; backend and frontend. And has the ability to scale services 

- [[Electronics]] - Well... very self-explanatory this works with the bearer-metal important for IoT for example

**We also have Machine learning and data scientists....**


### How to choose your path?

**Well, we can divide this between interaction with people, complexity time**
