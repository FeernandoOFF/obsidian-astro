# How to make friends

A friendship can develop weeks after you meet someone but takes a few months to become a [[close friend]]

- Acts of kindness (Our ancestors)
- [[Time ]]
- [Define with kind of person you're](Zettelkasten/Define%20with%20kind%20of%20person%20you're.md)
- Places to be (AKA Hobbies)
	- Not everybody can make friends at a bar or football game, park,
- Man form friendships around shared activities
- Local clubs, opportunities for volunteer 
- Hobby stores, sports, hiking, cooking


- Job.- Attracts people like you - consider this when you're choosing your carrier 

What about your friends that you've lost the touch with??
More often than not the other person will appreciate that you reached out

You can take the initiative


Frear to rejection?
- The other person too!
- Worst case they'll tell you
- bestcase life long friendship
