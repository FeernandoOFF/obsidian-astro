## Ideas

We make friends sharing **common time together**; this is especially notable on [[school and university]] when you are locked to similar **schedules** with more people

Proximity > Shared Interests 

Your "[[social calibrator]]" changes across your life 

## Friendship paradox
On average most people have fewer friends than their friends 
**Likely to be friends who someone who has many friends than with someone who has few** 
**Friendship networks are often build by [[central hubs]]**.
If **[[central people]]** disappear from your life this can private you with may connection at once. Worst with Big life events
