# Productivity with Obsidian

## Why obsidian?
Obsidian is a great tool to use as it lets you increase your knowledge incrementally with a minimum set-up and  implementing a basic [[Zettelkasten Methodology]] we can create a great note-taking system

**This method is good, because this structure emerge from the content it self**, unlike **folders** that have to be **pre-created**. This suits better to me because my brain is not that structured as an [[Note taking Archetypes#Architect]] or a [[Note taking Archetypes#Librarian]]

Also (and this is a advantage of almos every digital note taking app (AKA  [[Note taking Archetypes#Applications for each note taking archetype]] )) 
Is that instead of **creating notes and forget them**, how the **knowledge keeps increasing** even creating [[Maps of Content]] by creating [[Conceptual Notes]]


## How?
- Create a Zettelkasten Template ([[Core Zettle Idea]])
- Link Ideas with the tag **property** and **References**

By implementing this methodology it will naturally grow around the [[Obsidian tags]] and when you see in the [[Obsidian graph view]] a bunch of topics related around that tag, that means that **the topic is recurrent on your second brain** this are called [[Maps of Content]]

- When the [[Maps of Content]] are created we use the second Template (MOC)
	- This will work as a wrapper and remain empty or we can make an resume, index or whatever we want around that general topic
	IE: Use [[Obsidian Excalidraw Plugin]] to create a explanation of the topic with links going to specific subjects
