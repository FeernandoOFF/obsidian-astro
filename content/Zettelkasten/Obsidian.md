# What is obsidian?


> [!NOTE] Philosophy
> Obsidian lets you create the note first and then lets you organise however you want

Obsidian is a note taking app with a different approach to apps like Notion. It uses links and backlinks to create relations between concepts and notes, letting the knowledge grow by his own and create structures between topics

Obsidian has different features such as:

- [[Obsidian plugins]]
- [[Obsidian relations]]
- [[Obsidian templates]]
- [[Obsidian graph view]]
- [[Obsidian tags]]
